        <p>Packed with lots of charm, humour, and heart, TBS’ and Netflix’s Final Space is the new animated comedy that will keep the audience laughing till they fall off the edge of their seats. Created by Olan Rogers, the series revolves around a Gary Godspeed, a charming yet somewhat deluded astronaut, who has been imprisoned aboard the spacecraft, Galaxy One; after he accidentally destroys a fleet of imperial guard ships while trying to impress a girl. During his five year sentence, Gary stumbles upon a green life form which he affectionately names Mooncake. Cute, but deadly, Gary learns that looks are deceiving once it is revealed to him, that Mooncake has the ability to destroy other planets, as well as galaxies, making it a target for the Lord Commander, who wishes to use Mooncake’s abilities for his own personal use. Having bonded with the green death ball, Gary vows to protect Mooncake from the Lord Commander and his army, while simultaneously trying to save the universe and the fate of Earth once a breach in space has been discovered.</p>
